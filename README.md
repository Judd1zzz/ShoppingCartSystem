<h1 align="center"><b>📍 Telegram bot with shopping cart and payment system</b></h1>
<p align="center">This is my first open source code, so don't choke too much.</p>
<p align="center">I showed how it is possible to implement a system of receiving goods using a shopping cart and payment in a telegram bot</p>

<h1 align="center"><b>📝Installation</b></h1>
<p>To run the bot, you need python version 3.10+</p>
<p>The code is installed very simply:</p>

```
>>> git clone https://github.com/Judd1zzz/ShoppingCartSystem
>>> cd ShoppingCartSystem
>>> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<p>Put your values in the .env file</p>

```
BOT_TOKEN=
PAYMENTS_TOKEN=
ADMINS=
```

- PAYMENTS_TOKEN can be obtained in BotFather. To do this, select the bot you need, then click on Payments and select the deposit method you need.

<p>Now run the script:</p>

```
>>> python main.py
```

<p>If you did everything right, then the program should write:</p>

```
Bot was started
```
